## Implementation Details

### Analytics and Decisions
This release fixes a critical bug in the newly introduced extension handling logic.
1.  **Bug Fix**: The original implementation of extension depth checking was "greedy", meaning it would abort the entire extension detection if even one part of the requested depth was invalid (e.g., contained spaces). This caused inputs like `Name - Part.ext.ext2` (with depth 3 requested) to fail because ` - Part` is invalid.
2.  **Iterative Solution**: The logic in `zid_name.py` and `ref/obsidian_zid_wikilink.py` has been updated to be iterative. It now checks from the requested depth *down to 1*, accepting the longest suffix where all parts are valid extensions.
3.  **Regression Testing**: A new test case (`test_iterative_extension_fallback`) was added to `tests/test_extensions.py` to cover this scenario and prevent regression.

### Impact
- **Reliability**: Users can now safely set high `preserve_extension_depth` or `slugify_extension_depth` values without fear of valid extensions being ignored due to preceding invalid tokens.
