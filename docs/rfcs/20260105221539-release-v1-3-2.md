## Implementation Details

### Analytics and Decisions
This release focuses on stabilizing the codebase and ensuring consistency across configuration and testing.
1.  **Code Cleanup**: Removed accidental duplicate lines in `zid_name.py` that were introduced in previous edits.
2.  **Test Suite Update**: Refactored `tests/test_extensions.py` and `tests/test_zid_logic.py` to use the new integer-based configuration keys (`preserve_extension_depth`, `slugify_extension_depth`) instead of deprecated boolean/legacy keys. This ensures tests accurately reflect the production logic.
3.  **Configuration Update**: Updated `config.ini` and `config.ini.template` in the root directory to match the new keys and included explanatory comments (ported from `ref/`), ensuring users have clear documentation on how to use extension handling features.
4.  **Verification**: Validated that all 18 tests in the suite pass successfully.

### Impact
- **Maintenance**: The codebase is cleaner and tests are now reliable indicators of functionality.
- **User Experience**: Configuration is clearer with added comments in the template.
