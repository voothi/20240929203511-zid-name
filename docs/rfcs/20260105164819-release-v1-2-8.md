## Implementation Details

### Analytics & Decisions

1.  **Explicit Slug Extension Support (`20260105164819`)**:
    - **Context**: Users noticed that long titles combined with `slug_word_count` would truncate file extensions if they were part of the text.
    - **Decision**: Added `add_extension_to_slug` configuration.
    - **Logic**: If enabled (and `nesting_level=0`), the extension is detected, excluded from truncation, and appended to the final slug (e.g., `very-long-title-file.pdf` -> `very-long-title-pdf`).

2.  **Test Suite Refactoring (`20260105170145`)**:
    - **Context**: Maximum file size and complexity of `test_zid_name.py` made maintenance difficult.
    - **Decision**: Split tests into logical modules.
    - **Structure**:
        - `tests/test_basics.py`: Core string manipulation.
        - `tests/test_zid_logic.py`: ZID regex and batch handling.
        - `tests/test_extensions.py`: Extension logic (nesting & slug addition).
    - **Benefit**: Easier navigation and granular execution (`python -m unittest tests/test_extensions.py`).
