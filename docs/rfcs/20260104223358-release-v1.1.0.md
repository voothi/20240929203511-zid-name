## Staging

The release version is v1.1.0.
Ref: my request 20260104223358.

## Implementation Details

### Analytics & Decisions
- **Configurability**: Transitioned from hardcoded settings to a `config.ini` based approach. This allows users to customize the word limit, regex for character filtering, and specific character replacements without modifying the Python source.
- **Obsidian Template Alignment**:
    - **Variable Naming**: Renamed `word_limit` to `slug_word_count` to maintain consistency with the `SLUG_WORD_COUNT` variable in the Obsidian `_new.md` template.
    - **ZID Recognition**: Implemented ZID-aware word counting using the exact regex logic from the Obsidian template. This ensures that a 14-digit timestamp at the beginning of a line is preserved and excluded from the slug word count.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Configured `configparser` to be case-sensitive (`optionxform = str`) to allow distinctive handling of uppercase and lowercase special characters (e.g., `Ä` vs `ä`).
- **Improved Parsing**: Restricted `configparser` delimiters to `=` only to allow characters like colons (`:`) to be used safely as keys in the `[Replacements]` section.
- **Internationalization**: Fully translated the internal comments and docstrings of `zid_name.py` into English for better accessibility in the open-source ecosystem.
- **Stability**: Verified correct handling of special characters (like `ß`) and edge cases where ZID lines have prefixes (e.g., list markers `-` or `1.`).
