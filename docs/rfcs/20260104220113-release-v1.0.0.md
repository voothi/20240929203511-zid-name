# RFC: Release v1.0.0

Prepare documentation for v1.0.0 of the `zid-name` utility.

## Staging

The release version is v1.0.0.

## Implementation Details

### Analytics & Decisions
- **Slug Generation**: The tool is designed to convert raw titles into clean, hyphen-separated slugs suitable for filenames or ZID titles.
- **Word Limiting**: It extracts the first 6 words to keep filenames/titles concise while remaining descriptive.
- **Special Character Handling**: Replaces German umlauts (ä, ö, ü) and ß with their ASCII equivalents (ae, oe, ue, ss) and replaces other special characters with hyphens.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Can be run without arguments to process the current clipboard content, facilitating integration with automation tools like AutoHotkey.
- **AHK Integration**: Compatible with `zid-name.ahk` for a seamless "Copy-Process-Paste" workflow.
- **Version Numbering**: Initial release v1.0.0 establishes the core utility functionality.
